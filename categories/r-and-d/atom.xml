<h2>Customer</h2>

<p>One of the largest provider of Errors and Omissions Insurance and Risk Management Services. We have protected real estate professionals since 1996 and today protect more than 75,000 nationwide.</p>

<h2>Objective and solution</h2>

<p>Customer wanted to increase speed of the new functionality development. Along with this task there was a problem with compatibility of existing legacy software with new operating systems.</p>

<p>Team was assigned to research possibilities of integration of Visual Basic based software with Microsoft .NET technologies.</p>

<p>Solution:</p>

<ul>
<li>Recovered mission critical parts of technical documentation using reverse engineering techniques</li>
<li>Integrated .NET with existing software using ActiveX technology</li>
<li>The part of Visual Basic modules was converted to COM visible .NET assemblies</li>
</ul>


<h2>Project highlights</h2>

<ul>
<li>Successfully mixed new and legacy software bits</li>
<li>With new vision for architectural design increased productivity of development team</li>
<li>Once again company was able to quickly adopt to evolving business and market</li>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1>MMORPG Game Server</h1>

<h2>Customer</h2>

<p>A Russian startup company.</p>

<h2>Objective and solution</h2>

<p>Customer had a vision of a next generation <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massively_multiplayer_online_role-playing_game">MMORPG</a> (massive multiplayer online role playing game) but it had no expertise in client-server multiplayer games with high numbers of online users.</p>

<p>Our research and development group was asked to prepare general architectural recommendations and build a prototype of the game server.</p>

<p>The main requirements for the single game server instance were:</p>

<ul>
<li>High availability (no less than 99.999%)</li>
<li>Ability to handle up to 10 thousand simultaneous connections</li>
<li>Minimal network load. Users with 3G connection of 2048 Kbytes/sec should be able to play.</li>
</ul>


<p>Solution:</p>

<ul>
<li>Created custom binary protocol on top of UPD with delivery guarantee support for critical messaging scenarios</li>
<li>Network load minimized by sending only "deltas" - personalized chunks of data that actually changed.</li>
<li>High availability was assured by a Microsoft IIS web farm with load balancing</li>
</ul>


<h2>Project highlights</h2>

<ul>
<li>First version of working prototype was able to handle more than 2000 connections</li>
<li>Custom protocol that unified ideas of UDP broacasting and multicasting allowed significantly decrease load on network</li>
<li>Plugin based architecture weakened dependencies between server components and streamlined development process</li>
</ul>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1>Telemedicine Process Automation</h1>

<h2>Customer</h2>

<p>A Supplier of Mobile Cardiac Outpatient Telemetry that provides the next-generation ambulatory cardiac monitoring service with beat-to-beat, real time analysis, automatic arrhythmia detection and wireless ECG transmission.
It helps clinicians prevent morbidity, mortality and disability with rapid diagnosis and treatment of patients with cardiovascular disease.</p>

<h2>Objectives and Solution</h2>

<p>The project was to automate the process of ECG signal decoding transmitted via phone landlines and integrate solution with existent patient monitoring system.
Signal could be recorded in noisy place with distortions caused by landlines equipment. Also target was to successfully process no less than 70% of all records.</p>

<ul>
<li>Applied numerical analysis to the problem and created mathematical model for signal processing</li>
<li>Integrated with existing patient monitoring system through XML Web Services technology</li>
</ul>


<h2>Project highlights</h2>

<ul>
<li>Successfully designed and implemented self adaptive demodulator algorithm</li>
<li>Through reverse engineering technical documentation for supported cardiac monitors was re-defined and corrected</li>
<li>Application UX was designed for maximum personnel efficiency and fully supports control via keyboard</li>
</ul>
